Excel 
has a quick customization of tool in top 
we can either r8 click on stuffs to add it or use dropdown to add








components


Excel has 3 components
quick bar
formulae bar
ribbon bar

every square in excel is called a sheet

To go to the rock bottom
ctrl + down arrow

we can have upto 255 sheets

similarly if use ctrl + right arrow
it takes all the way to end

ctrl+ home brings back to a1

it gets stored as an excel xlxx doc





See when taking about entering data
a1 may have space over b1 but its only available on A1
to go through col - use tab
to go through row - use enter

create a monthly budget sheet with months on row and different exercise on columns with total

excel naturally forms numericals right aligned and text left aligned

see by default what happens in excel is they use mmmm-yy so we have to customize it accordingly

Go to custom and change the custom formatting to our wish

Cell refrence - A small concept stating tht which row and column the above set stuff is active

see formulae are usually added up using =  sign
 see jst using normal values instead of cell refrencing we would end up with static values
for dynamic values go for cell refrencing
=1200+90+29 nope instead
= b1+b4+b34


There are 2 types of cell refrencing 
relative refrencing
absolute refrencing

see takin abt of relative refrencing
its always relative to the location
say the total is sum of stuffs towards its left b5+c5+d5
see we can copy the formula and it will be jst modify accordingly

we can drag and drop the formula



When you wanna use a constant value and u wanna to save tht...don't go for relative reference instead go for absolute reference
it use $e$10 for maintaining it has a constant

PEMDAS
please excuse my dear aunt sally
parenthesis exponent multiple divsion addition sub

Automation of formulation - functions
See talkin abt functions it takes a function name
and arguments say for addition it takes c5 + c6 two things needed to added =Sum(A5:A6)

see all we have to do is go into formulae and click math and trig and find sum we can either drag or drop or type in for it get performed


To find a function very quickly go to insert function and type it we will get 
Max
Min
Count
AutoSum

see AutoSum
It helps in calculating all the sum naturally
but it goes vertical one first but we have to change autosum

See talkin abt autofill all we have to do is jst drug it thts all

Copy and moving a content
see its jst ctrl c and ctrl v note until marching ants are available we can paste em as much as possible

see inorder to add a column 
it should be either either


ctrl + (on keypad one)
or ctrl shift + incase if we don't have it


simlarly ctrl - to remove stuffs
jst play with those rows and columns

see we can resize the height and width of the container according to our will and wish
all we have to do is go to the center of the column once done jst dragg to the preffered height
if we are focussing on multiple stuffs it takes the max width and performs auto fit

auto fill is done when it is double clicked

if columns are too narrow they will endup with pound symbol

see for hiding a content all we have to do is choose the column once done right click and hide 
for unhiding stuffs all we have to do is scroll over 2 of them and unhide them

deleting a worksheet is not a undo process so be really carefull of tht

double click the sheet name to rename them as simple as that

use ctrl to move so tht it copies file

We can change the font size of the document as we wish

In terms of font color we have to drag and fill color
for non contiguous selection press ctrl we can show differences

Border 
we can give specific border for our needs so tht we can distinguish em

see inorder to give dollar sign we can give it by adding dollar sign or , to remove dollar sign

Incase if u dont find anything jst use comma

see talkin abt percentage we can just use percentage to use it we can increase or decrease the percentage decimal to get more accurate

Format painter
It is jst works like a copy paste it enhances the speed

To wipe the format
jst drag it and give clear formats

we can create our own premade style and we can use it accordingl

Merge and center used to align doc in center
it merges all the cell as one and aligns it to the center

conditional formatting
see if u wanna highlight something in red and highlight jst give it a conditional formatting

inserting image
we can jst insert image using the options above either from bing or local

Insert shapes
We can add shapes and use it to format the document
we can even manipulate beyond colors like adjusting tail angle so on

SmartArt are used to give diagrams for process flow and so on
jst pic smartArt we can either promote or depromote stuffs accordingly

bars and chart
for visual rep we need bars and chart
its simple all we have to do is drag and highlight then give it a graph

For 2d chart all we have to do is highlight it and chose one graph according to our wish

see takin abt the ribbon
the ribbon is very dynamic it can change based on what u r working on

For changing the name of the chart double tap on the name if u wanna perform more such actions give + and play with it

Adding and modifying
The values are circulated by color so we need to adjust them accordingly to show any updates in graph

Adding colors and other formattingg
Chose the graph...And go to formatting then select it and change the shape fill and other stuffs accordingly

Moving a chart
in design
select the chart
click move location
then create a new sheet

pie chart is used to store single data more effectively
it is called in the same way we call the bar plot
we have switch btw rows and columns to look at the data

print 
jst its available in home screen were u can get a preview on how printed document will be 

see in printing there are several options including landscape portrait and other stuffs
jst work with different such functions

Page layout
it works like a word document in formatting

Header and footer
See its found very easily on page view
all we have to do is add the necessary contents found on design

Print area
we can set and print area accordingly
so only the selected zone gets printed
its marked by a green border

Template
we can use template to so tht we need to do anything from scratch its as simple jst by giving del key

we can make a custom template jst my saving it as a custom xltx file

See there are two important concepts
there should not be any empty row
also There should always be an header

The main stuff in list is sorting based on ascending and descending order
jst go to data and give it a quick sort


Multiple level sorting
click on to the list data tab
then sort there are 2 such options 
note it will take last name first then if there is any common name it will solve accordingly

Custom sorting
we can even sort the stuffs in a custom manner its similarly how multiple level sorting works

Filter
see we can just use tht funnel filter stuff which pops up icon so tht we can filter everything according our wish

subtotal
it gives the total of the grp
but we have subtotal grp which makes it more simpler and easier

Formatting list as a row
see formatting list as row is a cool stuff coz the data will be updated automatically 

it is found in home

ctrl shift down arrow select all the way till values are there

Finding duplicate value
its jst by using conditional value then highlight it

Removing duplicate value
it can be either done by trt the value as a table and then removing it
or
in data we can remove it as a duplicate

DSUM
it is used to sum up based on a cluster
jst give dsum and then choose the range and what u wanna sum and finally the where u wanna 

ll'ly
we can do for DAVG

SUBTOTAL
it has value from 0 - 11 each having seperate stuffs
then we have to give it a reference

Data cleaning
We have to clean the data so tht it aint messy

we have to insert data from a premade stuff
it enables users only to do from what we set
Data validation can be done easily by going to the data then we have to give data validation
we can find it for already existed value by giving circle invalid groups

we can make a custom error and make sure developers can ease with tht

we can use this data validation dropdown in a much cooler manner so tht we can change data very quickly

Importing file
we can import external files like txt, csv
jst set the delimiters


Importing from microsoft access
if we have access to tht then we can set it by adjusting parametres to our needs

Exporting
Like importing we can even export files into any format we want

Pivot table
from detailed data to summarized table sheet is termed as pivot table

Creating a pivottable
see its on top of the insert
we can give the necessary data and location 
on clicking it will take care of stuffs

Then its all abt clicking and dragging
we have to know where should we drag what should we drag

see in terms of pivot table we may need to change the behavior of tht so we have to drag it and then play accordingly

we can evn create an difference based on previous

Grouping 
we can group our data jst going to analyze and then using group selection

we can format documents according to our needs

value fields and number format

we can further format stuffs accordingly on design and giving them various styles

Drilled down
it is used to access data
jst double click

PIVOT CHART
we can use the chart option to visualize the data

Filtering
When talking abt the filtering of data there will be dropdown we have to use it 

Slicer
This is the new tool select the table click on analyze then slicer
Then start filtering accordingly

Powerpivot is used to set datamodels
Tht sets up multiple data

see we have to create a powerpivot model tht holds up the relationship
We have to add the data model to the powerpivot

now go to the diagram view then drag and drop the relationship btw them

we can create a pivot table from tht powerpivot

we can also perform n number of works like autosum auto avg so on

KPI
it is used to setup the key process Indicator 
say if cost is less than 15$ its good more than 50$ its worse like tht

Freeze panes
it is used to freeze the headers so tht it is easy to sort things off

hiding adv
we can hide to columns by grouping them which will lead to new group

Printing adv
we may need our headings to occur
for tht we can go to page preview and set rows to repeat on top

we can also view the page preview
page break view to show where it breaks and doesn't
we can go over and then down to print stuffs accordingly

In some scenarios we need to sum up the entire values from other worksheets so for this case we will be using 3-d formula

its simply using =then going to various sheets to grab and sum it up

Consolidation
it is used to perform various action among different sheets


ADVANCED Concepts
Name range
addressing the name instead of row and column is called as a name range

jst grab the weeks which we wanna grab and on top change it to the name u like
then call tht whenever possible

IF
if condition is true yes or no
takes 3 parametres then we have to work accordingly
found in formulae

Nesting functions
we can nest one functions inside another
by jst calling the and we can add upto 255 of those


Countif
counting based on the conditions


Sum if
takes 3 arguments
range
which u want
what u want 

iferror is used along nslookup to jst justify the error
jst give what u wanna show 

vlookup 
it goes vertically and finds whatever parameter we jst ask for
it takes 4 parameter

Hlookup
it works like vlookup where it goes through horizontal stuffs here

entire excel is a big index we can use it to find the index of element

index finds the name and match finds its location

we can nest index with match

left mid right functions
All these are text functions helps in grabbing stuffs according left and r8 takes 2 positional arguments whereas mid takes one

Len 
This helps in giving out the length of the characters in the given text

search 
can be used along with left and it helps in segregating the value
we can find the first name using left and giving it a search
for finding last name we have to use r8 and - the search the length see lastname goes from right to left

concatenate as the name says it helps in adding up the elements


Tracing the precedence of the formulae
it helps to trace how a formulae is been used
usually arrow indicates the trace precedents

trace precedence and dependence are like arrow tht shows what makes up the formula

watch window pops up a new window through which we can do and watch changes of the values

show formulae shows up all the formulae and jst expands it

see basically every excel sheet is locked we have to remove the lock 
then protect it by using the review then go through some checks

we can even protect the entire workbook so tht no one will mess with tht

or we can jst protect it with a general lock stuff



Goal seek is kinda what if function
PMT helps in calculating the rate of interest and other stuffs
give it a - to change the value to +

see we will be manually adjusting the value but with the help of excel we dont need to do those

using goal seek we can adjust only one value


solver on the other hand can use multiple arguments 

jst activate it and we can fix multiple different arguments 

data table
first we have to structure the datatables 
then place the formulae on right top then create a data table then dragging will finish the necessary work


scenario manager
it helps in taking out one worksheet and use different different scenarios with tht


Excel Macro
see it does record all the ongoing operation and when we wanna redo it its jst a click

developers tab
A location tht contains all the macro tools

see we have to activate the hidden macro tab by right clicking it

macro records every changes it takes few argument
we have to start the recording and we have to stop the recording once done

vba
is the place where our codes are located for macro
then the macro changes are located on to the modules section we have to change it by altering the code

Then we have to create a btn to run macro whenevr it is necessary
